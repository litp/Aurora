# Aurora
A lightweight yet mordern PHP framework.

## Why another framework?

Yes, there are numerious frameworks for php development world, some of which are quite popular and effective. But I want to have a framework which meets those listed requirements:

* Lightweight
* Modern, with full object-oriented design and namespace convention.
* Direct, trying to avoid abstract and encapsulating as much as possible
* Portable, not local filesystem writting permission required
* Clean, easy to master, easy to modify, easy to follow the whole code


CodeIginiter is lightweight, but it is not modern designed (no namespace etc).

Laravel, on the other hand, is designed according to all the modern standards of PHP, but it is too heavy. I will use it as a fullstack framework, but I want something more light and portable to develop some projects.

Basically, Aurora trys to combine the advantages of CodeIginiter and Laravel, trys to create a framework lightweight and easy to use.
